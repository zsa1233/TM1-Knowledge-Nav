    "question": "Context:Understanding Multi-dimensionality\nWith IBM Cognos TM1, you can create multidimensional databases that provide business and finance managers instant meaning from complex, dynamic business models.\nTo understand multi-dimensionality, consider the example of the Vice President of Sales for a retail company who wants to analyze product sales across a retail chain that operates in the United States and Canada. Each retail store records the unit sales, dollar sales, and discounts for the durable consumer products.\nThe sales are analyzed by product, scenario (actual versus budget), region, measures (units, dollar sales, and discounts), and week. This example identifies a five-dimensional model. The dimensions identify how the data is organized or how the types of data are tracked.\nIn TM1, the sales analysis can reside in one or more multidimensional structures called cubes. A collection of cubes forms a database. Each data point in a cube is identified by one element in each dimension of the cube. For example, actual dollar sales of dryers during the second week of January in the Boston store. TM1 cubes must contain no less than two and no more than 256 dimensions. What is the purpose of multi-dimensional databases in IBM Cognos TM1?",
    "answer": "Multi-dimensional databases in IBM Cognos TM1 provide business managers with instant insights from complex, dynamic business models."
